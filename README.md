# Get-file-versions-from-.Net-classes-in-bulk
Checking file versions in bulk using .Net classes


I used this script to check PCI software version since it was a manual update, and there were no built-in tools to check the file version other than by remoting or logging in.

Like my other scripts, it uses CSV to pull IP addresses to do this in bulk, and records it in another CSV file.
